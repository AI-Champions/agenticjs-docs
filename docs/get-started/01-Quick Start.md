## Setup 

#### Install KaibanJS via npm:

```bash
npm install kaibanjs
```

#### Import KaibanJS in your JavaScript file:

```js
// Using ES6 import syntax for NextJS, React, etc.
import { Agent, Task, Team } from 'kaibanjs';
```

```js
// Using CommonJS syntax for NodeJS
const { Agent, Task, Team } = require("kaibanjs");
```

> Note: KaibanJS is TypeScript-supported. To learn more, check out the NodeJS TypeScript example.

## Example Usage

In this example, we use KaibanJS to build a resume generation team. If you're looking to create or update your resume, this setup utilizes specialized AI agents to automatically process your information and produce a polished, professional resume tailored to your career goals.


```js

// Define agents with specific roles and goals
const profileAnalyst = new Agent({
    name: 'Mary', 
    role: 'Profile Analyst', 
    goal: 'Extract structured information from conversational user input.', 
    background: 'Data Processor',
    tools: []  // Tools are omitted for now
});

const resumeWriter = new Agent({
    name: 'Alex Mercer', 
    role: 'Resume Writer', 
    goal: `Craft compelling, well-structured resumes 
    that effectively showcase job seekers qualifications and achievements.`,
    background: `Extensive experience in recruiting, 
    copywriting, and human resources, enabling 
    effective resume design that stands out to employers.`,
    tools: []
});

// Define the tasks for each agent
const processingTask = new Task({ 
  description: `Extract relevant details such as name, 
  experience, skills, and job history from the user's 'aboutMe' input. 
  aboutMe: {aboutMe}`,
  expectedOutput: 'Structured data ready to be used for a resume creation.', 
  agent: profileAnalyst
});

const resumeCreationTask = new Task({ 
    description: `Utilize the structured data to create 
    a detailed and attractive resume. 
    Enrich the resume content by inferring additional details from the provided information.
    Include sections such as a personal summary, detailed work experience, skills, and educational background.`,
    expectedOutput: `A professionally formatted resume in markdown format, 
    ready for submission to potential employers.`, 
    agent: resumeWriter 
});

// Create and start the team
const team = new Team({
  name: 'Resume Creation Team',
  agents: [profileAnalyst, resumeWriter],
  tasks: [processingTask, resumeCreationTask],
  inputs: { aboutMe: `My name is David Llaca. 
    JavaScript Developer for 5 years. 
    I worked for three years at Disney, 
    where I developed user interfaces for their primary landing pages
     using React, NextJS, and Redux. Before Disney, 
     I was a Junior Front-End Developer at American Airlines, 
     where I worked with Vue and Tailwind. 
     I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from FIU in 2018, 
     and I completed a JavaScript bootcamp that same year.` },  // Initial input for the first task
    env: {OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-open-ai-api-key'}  // Environment variables for the team
});

// Listen to the workflow status changes
// team.onWorkflowStatusChange((status) => {
//   console.log("Workflow status:", status);
// });

team.start()
  .then((output) => {
    console.log("Workflow status:", output.status);
    console.log("Result:", output.result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Workflow encountered an error:", error);
  });
```
