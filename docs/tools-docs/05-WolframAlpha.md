# WolframAlpha Tool

## Description

[WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is a powerful computational knowledge engine that provides detailed and accurate answers to complex queries. By leveraging the capabilities of WolframAlpha, this tool enables users to perform advanced computations, data analysis, and retrieve scientifically accurate information across a wide range of domains, including mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy, and more. Whether you need precise calculations, in-depth data analysis, or authoritative scientific knowledge, WolframAlpha offers the tools necessary to enhance your projects with reliable computational intelligence.


Enhance your agents with:
- **Advanced Computations**: Perform complex mathematical and scientific calculations.
- **Data Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze data from a vast knowledge base.
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Access precise and reliable information across various domains.

This tool is exclusively available in the [KaibanJS Playground](https://www.kaibanjs.com/playground).

## Installation

No installation is required for this tool as it is available directly in the [KaibanJS Playground](https://www.kaibanjs.com/playground). To get started with WolframAlpha, you can sign up for an App ID at [WolframAlpha Developer Portal](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/).

## Example

Utilize the WolframAlphaTool as follows to enable your agent to perform advanced computations and retrieve detailed answers:

```javascript
// No need to import; available in the KaibanJS Playground
const tool = new WolframAlphaTool({
  appId: "ENV_WOLFRAM_APP_ID",
});

const scientificAnalyst = new Agent({
    name: 'Eve', 
    role: 'Scientific Analyst', 
    goal: 'Perform complex computations and provide accurate scientific data for research and educational purposes.', 
    background: 'Research Scientist',
    tools: [tool]
});
```

## Parameters

- `appId` **Required**. The App ID generated from [WolframAlpha](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/). Set `'ENV_WOLFRAM_APP_ID'` as an environment variable or replace it directly with your App ID.
