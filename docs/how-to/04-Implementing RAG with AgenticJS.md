title: Implementing RAG with AgenticJS
description: Learn how to enhance your AI agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation.
---

> Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the performance of AI agents. This technique can significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of responses by incorporating contextually rich information retrieved from a large corpus.

## Setup and Requirements

This guide will outline the steps needed to integrate RAG into your AgenticJS projects. Before proceeding, ensure you have the latest version of AgenticJS and access to a suitable database or knowledge base for retrieval purposes.

## Step-by-Step Guide
