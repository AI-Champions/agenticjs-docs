Certainly! I understand you want a more concise version of the LLMs Docs section, with the main information condensed into the overview pages until more models are added. Here's a simplified structure with concise content for each overview:

```
LLMs Docs
├── Overview
├── Built-in Models
│   └── Overview
└── Custom Integrations
    └── Overview
```

Here's the content for each overview:

1. LLMs Docs > Overview

KaibanJS supports multiple Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of your AI agents. This flexibility allows you to optimize your AI solutions for accuracy, efficiency, and tailored outcomes.

Currently supported models include:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Google
- Mistral

For integration with models not yet supported, please submit a request on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS/issues).

2. Built-in Models > Overview

```markdown

title: Built-in LLM Models
description: Overview of pre-integrated Language Models in KaibanJS.

KaibanJS comes with several pre-integrated LLMs, ready to use out-of-the-box:

- OpenAI (e.g., GPT-4)
- Anthropic (e.g., Claude)
- Google (e.g., Gemini)
- Mistral

To use a built-in model, specify it in the agent's `llmConfig`:

```js
const agent = new Agent({
    name: 'Emma',
    role: 'Drafter',
    llmConfig: {
        provider: 'openai',
        model: 'gpt-4',
    }
});
```

API keys can be set in the `llmConfig` or globally in the team's `env` property.
